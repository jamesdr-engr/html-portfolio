<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m James De Rueda, a Computer Engineering student exploring the world of software development, web development, and game creation. I started coding with Lua for game development, but now I’m diving into Java, OOP, databases, and recently web development, figuring out how to balance efficiency with my natural tendency for laziness (which I see as a tool for smarter problem-solving).</p>
<p>Beyond programming, I have a strong passion for writing, particularly fiction, poetry, and introspective narratives that reflect personal experiences, emotions, and psychology. I even run a Facebook page(which I won't post), where I share poetry and thoughts.</p>
<p>I’m also a gym-goer, a former Amumu jungle main in LoL, and someone who enjoys gaming—not just playing but possibly creating them in the future. My career path is still open-ended, considering everything from full-time game development to web development or even pursuing a master’s degree that combines tech, business, and leadership.</p>
<p>Despite overthinking and being emotionally driven, I tend to make practical decisions. I value friendships but have also learned the importance of boundaries. I overanalyze things a lot, but at the end of the day, I just want to create, improve, and keep moving forward—whether in coding, writing, or life itself.</p>
